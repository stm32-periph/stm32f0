@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library and
an associate SPI SDcard driver to communicate with an SDcard available on The eval board.

The first step consist in filling the SPI Tx buffer. Then this last one is written 
on the micro sd cards. A comparison between the Buffer transmitted (Buffer_Block_Tx)
and the received one (Buffer_Block_Rx) is done and LED1 is turned on in case of 
success otherwise LED2 is turned on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - MicroSD card is already available on this board.
    
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - MicroSD card is already available on this board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval_spi_sd.c
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval_spi_sd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
